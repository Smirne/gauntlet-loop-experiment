# Open defects

Found during integration verification. Fed into the post-build fix wave.
Each entry names the owning module per ARCHITECTURE.md section 3.

## D1 — `Materials.carPaint()` renders invisible — CRITICAL — FIXED
`render/Materials.js` [A3]. Root cause: the flake and orange-peel fragment blocks rotate an
object-space direction into view space with `normalMatrix`. three declares that uniform in
the **vertex** prefix only, so referencing it from the fragment stage is an undeclared
identifier, the program fails to link, and the material draws nothing at all.

My first two diagnoses were wrong and worth recording: I assumed the injected chunk was
zeroing alpha, and separately trusted `renderer.debug.checkShaderErrors` reporting "no
error" — the error *was* being logged, but a filtered console read returned nothing and I
took that as absence of evidence. Reading the unfiltered console gave the exact line.

Fix: re-declare `uniform mat3 normalMatrix;` in the fragment prefix when `flake` or `peel`
is active, guarded against double declaration. GLSL uniforms are program-wide, so it binds
to the value three already uploads. Verified in `shots/mats-fixed.png` — flake sparkle and
clearcoat highlight both resolve.

## D2 — `Materials.plasticToy()` renders invisible — CRITICAL — FIXED
Same root cause as D1 (shared `peel` path), fixed by the same change. Verified.

## D3 — `Materials.rubber()` crushes to pure black
`render/Materials.js` [A3]. Reads as a void, not a substance. Real tyre rubber has a soft
broad sheen and sits around 0.05–0.08 albedo, not 0. Needs a specular response so the
silhouette separates from shadow.

## D4 — `brushedAluminium` reads as matte blue paint, not metal
`textures/Surfaces.js` + `ProcTex.js` [A3]. Albedo carries a strong blue tint and the
roughness map is high enough across the surface that the metal never resolves a specular
highlight. Should be near-neutral grey with anisotropic streaks and roughness ~0.25–0.40.

## D5 — `oak` has blue-tinted knot artifacts
`textures/ProcTex.js` [A3]. Knots and nail holes render as desaturated blue dots. Should be
dark warm brown. The grain, plank seams and ray fleck are otherwise excellent — this is a
palette bug in the knot pass only.

## Verification notes (not defects)

- Browser module registry caches a **failed** dynamic import for the document's lifetime.
  Re-importing a module that 404'd at boot returns the cached rejection even after the file
  lands on disk. **Always hard-reload before verifying.** Cost me one false diagnosis.
- A metallic sphere in a scene with a dark environment map reads as near-black and looks
  "missing". Judge metals against a lit floor before calling them broken — this produced one
  false positive before the re-test with an oak floor disambiguated it.
